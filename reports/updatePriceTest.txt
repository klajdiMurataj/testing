For this method we are going to test coverage so therefore :
a:Statement Coverage:
we have some cases which prohibit us from accessing full statement coverage and therefore we test the 
conditions allowing us to preogress further if:
-either startdate or endDate is null
-if a date is a date of the past
-if a date is not in the correct range 
-if an exception is raised during the try clause

b:branch coverage:
we have made sure that our method can appear in the
case where the statement passes and the case where 
the statement fails,thus ensuring that the conditions are passed and failed

c:condition coverage:
for the first condition we have :
startDate=null,endDate=null->true
startDate=null,endDate!=null->true
startDate!=null,enddate=null->true
startDate!=null,endDate!=null->false

for the second condition:
isNotPastDate->false
!isnotPastDate->true

for the third condition:
isValidRange->false
!isValidRange->true

d:MC/DC:
in this case we have a complete MC/DC because if we 
flip the value of start date we get different results and also if we flip the value of end date we get different results so they are both independent 
furthermore if we flip isNotPastdate or isValidRange we also get different results so since they are binary decisions then theya re independent
